# Meta-FolderMaker
Dependecy: https://github.com/colelamers/XmlSerialization-and-Debug-Logging-DLL

This program works similarly like Tags2Folders but is much leaner and OSS. It gets the metadata tags from your files using the TagLibSharp library based off of the arist, album, or title. Then it'll create the directories of those stated tag and either copy or move the files to the stated path.
This program additionally uses the DebugLogging library linked above as well for the configuration and debug log.
